USER REQUEST:
${prompt}

Based on this information, suggest ONE specific edit that would most improve the video. Consider:
1. Pacing and flow between clips
2. Engagement and visual interest
3. Overall quality and polish
4. The user's specific request
5. Exercise set timing and transitions

When suggesting edits for exercise clips:
- Consider trimming dead time before/after exercise sets
- Suggest zooming during key exercise moments
- Maintain complete sets without splitting them
- Ensure transitions align with natural exercise boundaries`;
